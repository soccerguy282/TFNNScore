# TFNNScore
A Keras implementation of NNScore described in "Soft Computing Tools for Virtual Drug Discovery" by Daniel M Hagan and Martin T Hagan.

tfnnscoremod.py has a deep network (5 layers) and is just a version of tfnnscore.py I made to mess around with different architectures, hyper-parameters, etc. to see if I could improve the original model. Feel free to try your own network architecture by modifying the sequential model inside the fit_model function, see if you can improve accuracy. However, it will be hard to do much better on this data, we are more interested in a solution for a better training set, as the accuracy on the test set from these models doesn't translate to a larger, more diverse benchmark. We have though of possibly redocking all PDB complexes, or using our SOM to find generated bad binders that better cover the PDB space. Let us know you thoughts @ dhagan@okstate.edu. Thanks!
